# The Rick and Morty app

Web application for browsing Rick &amp; Morty characters.

## The challenge

- The web application should have a single grid view, displaying characters as cards (first 20 characters).
- Character cards should display characterâ€™s image and name as well as a like button.
- By clicking on a character card, the user should be presented with character details, showing all other fields of the character schema.
- If communication errors occur, they should be presented to the user without breaking the usability of the application.
